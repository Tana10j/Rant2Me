            <h2>CEO: Dorcas Eduk</h2>
            <p>Dorcas Eduk is a passionate woman on a mission to bridge wellness, technology, and human connection.

                She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Human Nutrition and Dietetics from Ambrose Alli University, where she developed a strong understanding of how food, science, and lifestyle influence both physical and emotional wellbeing.
                
                As a wellness advocate, Dorcas has worked with clients across a wide range of needs, from managing diet-related health conditions to making sense of data for smarter, more human-centered decisions. Her approach is grounded in empathy, and genuine respect for individual experience.
                
                She founded RANT2ME to offer a soft, anonymous space for people who simply need to let it all out without pressure, judgment, or unwanted advice.Dorcas is there to listen.
                
                When she’s not holding space for others, she’s often buried in a book, chasing something new to learn, or dreaming up her next hair goal.</p>
